# Project 6: LED turns ON for 5 seconds on button press - the use of timers in Arduino

1. Understand the use of timers in Arduino and problems that they can solve

## Write a program that does the following:
- Turn on an LED on pin 4 when a button is pressed using interrupts
- The LED should turn off after 5 seconds
- Do not use a delay() function here. Please use the system clock to measure the time. look for the millis() function in the Arduino reference.
Test the code and make sure it works as expected

## update the code to add a delay in the loop function
- Add the same for loop as in the previous exercise to simulate a long process. Does the LED still turn off after 5 seconds? Why or why not?
answer here: No, because the turn-off logic is blocked by the for-loop

## Write a second program. The proper way to solve this problem is to use a timer
- install package mstimer2 from the library manager
- read the readme file of the package and note the package limitations
- open an example of the package, examine the code and its functions and how to use them.
- implement a timer to turn off the LED after 5 seconds
- note the callback in the timer. When is it called?
    Only after the specified time (5 seconds).

## Exercises
- check that although the delay of 1 second is still in the loop function, the LED now turns off after 5 seconds

- change the LED time ON from 5 seconds to 30 ms, measure in the scope the time the LED is ON. is it 30 ms? Why or why not?
answer here: 
    Yes, it works well. Because the callback is now called every 30ms
